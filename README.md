The mirrorroi plugin was created for Osirix MD (Pixmeo) to mirror a region of interest (2D ROI) on the X axis. The intention was to analyse 2D ROI of PET scans in which the ROI was present in one leg of a human participant and the plugin mirrored the ROI onto the contralateral leg to allow a control SUV to be calculated. By selecting anatomical landmarks such as bony crests and mid-marrow, the plugin mirrors all the 2D ROIs in a sequence. Manual corrections can then be made.
